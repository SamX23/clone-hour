# Hello

This repo contains my files on cloning web using plain html, css and js only for one hour whatever the result.

My rules will be :

- Clean Code
- As semantic ways as possible
- No libraries
- Use basic modern web development (HTML5, CSS3 and JS ES6 or more)

I hope I can do this not only once, and increase my ability in web development while I share to you guys on Internet.

Work in progress, but enjoy the result :)
